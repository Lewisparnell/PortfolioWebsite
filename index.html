<p>
I thrive in a fast-pace working environment, overcoming daily challenges through problem-solving and being self-motivated. I manage large workloads through prioritisation and using my initiative to complete tasks in efficient ways. Strong desire to continue my career path within the tech industry. I can offer the company my vast technological knowledge and apply my experience to the daily tasks required to be fulfilled in this role.
In my free time I enjoying staying up-to-date on the latest tech news by reading several different news outlets, and watching reviews and informative videos on YouTube. I also have a passion for learning new skills and have been spending my down time learning how to program and have been setting myself several small tasks each week to work on.
